# CUBE CSS with Tailwind CSS

An example of how you can use Tailwind CSS as the U (utilities) in CUBE CSS. It also uses the following:

1. [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) layouts as compositional layouts (the C in CUBE CSS) 
2. [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) for fluid type and spacing scales 
3. [Post CSS](https://postcss.org/) to bundle up CSS files

## Why? 

I work with clients that like to use Tailwind and I, as part of the
consultancy work I do, try to encourage them down the path of a CSS
methodolody, rather than leaning all-in on a CSS framework. 

Tailwind is _fantastic_ at generating utility classes with an
easy-to-understand config file, but I find it very limiting and rigid as the
entire CSS codebase, so this project uses it how I would ideally use it:
purely as the utility generator.

Consider this project diplomacy.

## Getting started 

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start` to spin up a little local server and watch for CSS changes
2. Run `npm build` to compress CSS etc

No thanks, but if you see something fundamentally wrong (not just your
opinions, thanks), then let me know in the issues!
